          Hey! I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft, and studied Computer
          Science at the University of Toronto. I'm originally from Kenya, but
          moved to Toronto for University and am now in Vancouver for work. I
          was an active member in both UofT and the Toronto tech scene. A former
          Computer Science Student Union president, a member of the
          Undergraduate Women in Computer Science group, and an organizer for
          various events in Toronto and am looking for great events to attend in
          Vancouver. I've also spoken at conferences highlighting hackathons and
          Womenâ€™s Empowerment. Aashni founded the first Collegiate hackathon in
          Canada, UofTHacks, and has since enjoyed watching hackathons evolve
          and grow. I enjoy writing about my experiences at different tech
          events, and have interned at companies in Jakarta, Nairobi, Seattle
          and Toronto. I love photography, and have been sharing photos through
          #project365 on Instagram. Feel free to reach out!
